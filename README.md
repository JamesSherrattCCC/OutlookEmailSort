# OutlookEmailJobSort
Outlook addin which labels emails with a particular job then saves the labelled emails to a database

Note: an `App.config` file is needed. You can use [AppExample.config](EmailToJobDB/AppExample.config) as a template.
This will need renaming to `App.config` to work. Edit it accordingly to connect your database.
